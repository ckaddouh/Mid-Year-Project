# Mid-Year-Project
Memory Game
Our 2019-2020 midyear project is a matching card game that displays a 4 by 6 grid of face down cards that the user must eliminate by selecting matches. Cards are flipped by clicking on them, and once two are flipped, if they are a match, they are removed. Otherwise, they are flipped back over and the player must do their best to remember. Once all of the cards are matched, the game is over.
